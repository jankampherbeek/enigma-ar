## Calculating the Julian Day Number

The Julian Day Number, often abbreviated as JD, is used in astronomical calculations to work with time. A JD number indicates the time in days, and fractions of days, since January 1, 4713 BC at 12:00 UT. For even earlier periods, the day number is negative. The Julian Day Number has no relation to the Julian calendar.

To calculate the day number, enter the date in the format `yyyy/mm/dd`; you can only use forward slashes as separators. For periods before the start of our era, you must use astronomical year numbering. The year 10 BC is then -9. This is because the civil year numbering does not include the year zero.

Enter the time in the format `hh:mm:ss`; always use a colon as a separator. You must also enter the seconds.

For the calendar, enter a **G** for the Gregorian calendar or a **J** for the Julian calendar. For the current time, you must always use the Gregorian calendar.

Click the *Calculate JD* button to perform the calculation. You will see the result at the bottom of the screen. If you make an error in the input, you will receive a notification about it.
